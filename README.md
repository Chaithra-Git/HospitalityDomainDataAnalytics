# 🏨 Hospitality Domain Data Analytics

This project focuses on analyzing hotel booking data using Python and SQL to derive actionable insights. The analysis involves data import, cleaning, transformation, and visualization to understand trends and patterns in hotel bookings.

## 📊 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to perform end-to-end data analytics in the hospitality domain by working with multiple related datasets. The key tasks included:

- Importing and integrating data from multiple CSV files
- Performing exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Cleaning and transforming raw data for consistency and usability
- Deriving insights on booking trends, occupancy, room types, and seasonal demand
- Visualizing key metrics to support data-driven decision-making

## 🧾 Datasets Used

The project uses five CSV files structured as a dimensional data model:

- `dim_date.csv` – Date dimension with calendar attributes
- `dim_hotels.csv` – Hotel information (e.g., hotel name, location)
- `dim_rooms.csv` – Room categories and capacities
- `fact_bookings.csv` – Detailed booking transactions
- `fact_aggregated_bookings.csv` – Pre-aggregated booking metrics for fast querying

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**
- **SQL** for data querying and joins
- **Jupyter Notebook** for interactive analysis
- **Git/GitHub** for version control

## 📈 Key Insights

- Identified booking trends by season and hotel type
- Analyzed occupancy rates across different room categories
- Uncovered high-performing hotel segments and time windows
- Cleaned and structured raw data for repeatable analysis workflows
